## What Distro should I use?
> NOTE: Distro = Distribution, A modification of GNU/Linux, tailored to a philosophy, use-case, or more.

Choosing the right distro for *you* can be hard, so for the sake of this guide, we advise you to use **Linux Mint**: an Ubuntu-based distro that is perfect for beginners.
After you finish this guide and feel comfortable with your knowledge of Linux, you can switch to another distro [here](../../guides/distro)
