## Contributing

If you want to help the wiki grow, the best way is to spread the word and support the wiki via *contributing*! This guide will tell you how to do so.

## Contributing via Discord

If you do not know how to code, or don't want to create a pull request on GitHub, consider suggesting changed via Discord!

To do so:

<Steps>

1. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/pQVYgjzM3w) if you hadn't already!

2. Locate the *#suggestions* channel.

3. Tell us about your idea! It can be either as simple as adding or starring a new site, or as convoluted as enhancing the layout of the wiki, ideas for new pages etc.! The only requirement is that you need to explain to us your reason for suggesting it.

</Steps>

## Contributing via GitHub

### Issues

If you don't want to contribute on Discord for whatever reason, but still don't want to engage with the code, considering using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rimsiw/rims-linux-wiki/issues)!

With suggestions, please tell us your reasoning for a suggestion. However, GitHub Issues can also be used for reporting any bugs in the site, at any level of urgency. While reporting, please include steps to reproduce your problem!

### Pull Requests

If you want to contribute to the wiki at its base-level, consider using [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/rimsiw/rims-linux-wiki/pulls).

While contributing, keep in mind the [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/), as the site pages are written in MDX.
